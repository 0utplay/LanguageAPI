LanguageAPI - Translate your Plugins
-
What is LanguageAPI?
- 
The LanguageAPI aims to make it easy to translate your plugins. As developer, you can use the LanguageAPI to give the
user the opportunity to translate messages in every language the user wants to, this solves the problem of dealing with
different languages in files.

As plugin user, the LanguageAPI gives you the opportunity to edit messages ingame with commands to make it easy
and grant access to other staff-members

How to use?
-
The API is pretty self explaining. Use ``LanguageAPI.getInstance()`` to obtain an instance and work with.
